                        Login was generic, which is what client wanted and was happy about. They also liked how the

                        Registration for both Restaurant and Foodie was really good, the clients liked how 
                        we added validations on each field, so users couldnâ€™t put random information. They liked

                                <b>Commits and Merges</b>: When a developer commits any portion of code, the commits
                                must be coherent and logically grouped.
                                For example, 2 changes that are not related should not be grouped into a single commit
                                and should be separated, however 2 changes that are part
                                of the same change should be put into a single commit. Commits must also be small and
                                logical, large commits tend to be difficult to read and follow and hence
                                we will refrain from making such changes. Commit messages must succintly summarize what
                                changes were made for other developers to understand the code at any
                                point as well assist in debugging for any developer. Commit messages do not need to have
                                any specific format as long as they allow other developers to understand
                                changes that were made.

                                Code style must follow React best practices and must be readable by other developers.
                                Any code that is pushed onto the main remote repository must come with
                                comments that describe the code and be properly documented for other developers to use.

                    After completing our first sprint and receiving feedback on our previous deliverable, we
                    realized our backlog needed some modifications. Hence we now updated it to follow typical
                    product backlog practices, by removing the subtasks and keeping only the stories and
                    grouping the stories by features for more organization.

                accommodate. This extra day added on to each sprint is used to finalize our merges and
                approve the release pull request to the master branch.

            <div class="card-body pl-4">
                <p class="bold">NOTE: Our sprint ends on July 21th, 2020 and we 
                    will attempt to update the following as soon as possible.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Velocity</h5>
                <p> Compared to our previous sprint, this sprint saw a tremendous improvement in terms of velocity.
                    We estimated our velocity to be 38 points by the end of this sprint. Our actual velocity, with
                    1 day remaining is 29.5, leaving just 8.5 points to be completed. This is a great improvement
                    from our last sprint, where our actual velocity was about half of our estimated velocity.
                </p>
                <p> Below is the burndown chart that depicts the progress of the team from estimated to actual.</p>

                </p>

                <h5>Sprint Reflection</h5>
                <p> After Sprint 1, the team learned that putting in proper time to plan out our tasks
                    was incredbly important. So this sprint we set aside a day for sprint planning
                    where we discussed the sprint plan in detail. Due to this, we determined a more
                    realistic plan which we followed consistently throughout the week.
                    <br>
                    Our project progressed quite well from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2, we managed to fully
                    implement the login functionality, as well as the menu page for a restaurant user.
                    Upon logging in as a restaurant user, they are redirected to the restaurant dashboard,
                    where they can view their restaurant's info, menu and chefs. The ability to edit a restaurant's
                    item is also working. Alongside this we have set up the components required to add and delete the
                    items and will begin connecting them in the next sprint.
                </p>

                    Luckily for our project, we have not needed to use our contingency plan. Developers have been
                    following their tasks fairly well and have not needed to resort to any other methods for completing
                    tasks. If anyone was having difficulties completing their tasks, we all worked together to ensure
                    they got the help they needed, by setting up meetings to discuss the code.
