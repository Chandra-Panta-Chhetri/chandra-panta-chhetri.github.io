                            </br>
                            Every member of our team will be a Full Stack Developer. As we mentioned in the first
                            deliverable, we would like
                            take this project as a good learning opportunity to learn everything we can from the type of
                            development we are doing.
                            In this role, each member will get the opportunity to develop using front-end and back-end
                            technologies. I.e. a developer
                            may be assigned a task that could be either front-end utilizing React JS, or a back-end task
                            utilizing Node JS.
                            </br>
                            <em>Non-Developmental Roles</em>
                            </br>
                            The team will rotate on a weekly basis of who will attend meetings and take notes. On some
                            weeks, 2 members of the team
                            will attend the client meeting, and 2 different team members will attend the Friday meeting.
                            Members who are attending will be chosen
                            by the team based on availablity. During this meeting, the two members attendig must take
                            notes and share with the other team members to
                            keep them up to date.

                            Our main method of communication will be Facebook Messenger. Our
                            secondary option will be Microsoft Teams. In the case of emergency
                            we will be using phone or text.

                            Due to the current situation with Covid-19, we will not be holding
                            any in-person meetings. Instead we will hold virtual meeting through
                            Facebook Messenger's video call functionailty.
                            </br>These meetings will be Mondays 1-3 pm and Wednesdays 3-6 pm. </br>

                                This branch also branches of the Dev branch</br>

                                <b>Commits and Merges</b>: When a developer commits any portion of code, the commits
                                must be coherent and logically grouped.
                                For example, 2 changes that are not related should not be grouped into a single commit
                                and should be separated, however 2 changes that are part
                                of the same change should be put into a single commit. Commits must also be small and
                                logical, large commits tend to be difficult to read and follow and hence
                                we will refrain from making such changes. Commit messages must succintly summarize what
                                changes were made for other developers to understand the code at any
                                point as well assist in debugging for any developer. Commit messages do not need to have
                                any specific format as long as they allow other developers to understand
                                changes that were made.

                                Code style must follow React best practices and must be readable by other developers.
                                Any code that is pushed onto the main remote repository must come with
                                comments that describe the code and be properly documented for other developers to use.

                <p>
                    After getting through some of our sprint, we realized that our current point estimates and
                    priorities needed to be revised, as we discovered that we need a bit more time to adjust to the
                    learning curve. Hence we modified our backlog, to accommodate for the extra time required to get
                    familiarized with the tools and technologies being used.

                Our sprints will last for 2 weeks or 10 business days. We choose this duration as it
                gives us sufficient time to make significant changes to the the project and its features.
                This choice of sprint length was chosen to accommodate for the different levels of difficulty
                for different tasks, as well accommodate for the learning curve a developer may need to go
                through to get some task done.This 2 week length also allows the developers to have enough
                time to complete as many tasks as they can in the period as opposed to a 1 week sprint which
                gives too little time and 3 weeks which gives too much time to developers. The 2 week sprint
                seems to give the right balance of time to develop and test.

            <div class="card-body pl-4">
                <p class="bold">NOTE: Although a complete sprint has not completed for this group, we will attempt to
                    answer the following
                    questions to the best of our abilities. As mentioned above, our sprint ends on July 6th, 2020 and we
                    will attempt to update the following
                    as soon as possible.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Velocity</h5>
                <p> With nearly half the sprint completed, we feel that the project is moving at a good pace. Although
                    the burndown chart may show that the rate
                    at which tasks are completed are slow this is largely due to the learning curve that came with
                    learning the technology required to build the project.
                    With the daily talks that the team has, we are beginning to understand how develop effectively using
                    the technology we have, and are picking up the pace of development.
                    We believe that by the end of the sprint, we will be able to accomplish what we had set out
                    initially.
                </p>
                <p> Below is the burndown chart that depicts the progress of the team from estimated to actual.</p>

                    <img src="assets/burndown-chart-half-sprint.png" width="80%" height="80%" />
                </p>

                <h5>Sprint Reflection</h5>
                <p> The plans set out by the team were initially thrown off track a little bit by the set up process
                    that was involved for the project. However, after overcoming
                    the inital set up that was required to run the project, the team got right back on track and began
                    completing tasks as they were planned. In the end, it seems
                    that we have balanced out the initial pace set out and the current pace of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily for our project, we have not needed to use our contingency plan. Developers have been
                    following their tasks fairly well and have not needed to resort to
                    any other methods for completing tasks.
