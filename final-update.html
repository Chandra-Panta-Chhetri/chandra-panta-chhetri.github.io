                <p>
                    Initially the project had a shaky start. The group had very little idea on what technology to use to
                    develop the app. Later on we settled on the MERN stack as it was modern and there was good community
                    support so solutions would be easy to find. When it came to actually setting up the project, many of
                    us were unfamiliar with the stack and setting up took several days of time. As a result, the project
                    had a slow initial start. As we approached the completion of the first sprint, most group members
                    became familiar with the technology and development quickly sped up. Our initial client meeting demo
                    showed some good results, and we were given good feedback to bring the app more in line with the
                    client’s
                    requirements and interpretation of the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the second sprint, the team progressed far faster and was able to develop many of the
                    required
                    features that the client had requested. However, after the second sprint had completed the client
                    meetings
                    indicated some large changes in our application that we would need to change for the final release.
                    As
                    a result of this meeting, some replanning had to be done during the start of the third sprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A majority of the third sprint was spent adding the finishing touches to our project and making sure
                    we met
                    the requirements made by the client. As the sprint cumulated, we had finished the requirements set
                    out and had
                    written some unit tests to verify that the product is working, as well as added the changes
                    requested by the
                    client. With the other deadlines approaching, our best attempt was made at the project during the
                    last week to
                    provide as much of a complete product as we could.

                <h5>Planning and Replanning</h5>
                <p> During the first sprint and first half of the second sprint, we had a relatively smooth sailing 
                    experience. The project was going as planned. However, there was some replanning that needed to 
                    be done during the latter of sprint 2 and beginning of sprint 3. Both these periods of replanning 
                    were needed due to changes in client requirements. The client no longer required that we have a 
                    view for the chef of a restaurant, as well, they recommended some modifications to the landing 
                    page that required us to rework quite a bit of the front-end of the application.
                </p>

                <h5>Deliverable 5 Work Compared to Previous Deliverables</h5>
                <p>
                    Deliverable 5 sprint may have not gone too well compared to what we had initially planned. The reason 
                    being is because we did not take into consideration that all our courses would be having similar due 
                    dates, since the semester is coming to an end. In the first sprint, we overestimated our points, because 
                    we didn't realise there was a huge learning curve for the members not familiar with the MongoDB, React, 
                    Express and also Node.js. Even If some knew a little, this project requires a deep understanding of these 
                    languages/database to truly use these tools efficiently. Our second sprint was our best sprint, since we 
                    took into consideration each member's skill in each language and we used that to assign tasks to maximize 
                    the efficiency and to allow people to learn properly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the latest sprint we finished, we thought we would be able to finish more tasks, since we all got familiar
                     with the MERN stack and sprint 2 was a success. Hence, we chose to do 103 Story points. But we ended up only 
                     completing 60 story points, because of certain troubles we all had during the week with other course 
                     assignments/presentations we were not expecting. Even if the story points were significantly less, we still 
                     managed to finish the priority pages that the clients wanted like the restaurant page, landing page redesign, 
                     discover restaurant page, analytics and resigned about us page for this sprint. We believe that this sprint went
                      successfully in terms of completing pages that the client wanted us to fix.
