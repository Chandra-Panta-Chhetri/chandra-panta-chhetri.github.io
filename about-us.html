                    I am a third year Computer Science student at University of Toronto. I am passionate
                    about learning new technology and solving problems. I am experienced in following
                    languages: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript. From September 2019 to April 2020, I worked
                    at Ontario Power Generation (OPG) as a Software Developer Intern. During these 8 months
                    of internship, I successfully developed an enterprise wide in-house Project Risk Management
                    software solution within TIBCO EBX5 using Java and JavaScript (jQuery). Along with developing
                    intuitive custom UI forms, I also implemented a complex row/cell level security solution using
                    Java. I followed full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), and so many other types of development
                    and was involved in the design, testing, deployment/rollouts, and documentation. I am excited to
                    work on this project with this amazing team. In my free time I like to play badminton, chess and
                    solve competitive programming problems. I believe this project would surely help me sharpen/learn
                    new skills.

                    I am a third year student in the Software Engineering Specialist program at the UTSC, with
                    experience working with a few different languages such as Java, C and Python. My interests
                    specifically lie in web and application development. During my co-op term as a junior
                    developer at Fidelity Canada ULC, I gained a solid understanding of web-application
                    development, specifically working with technologies such as MEAN stack. During my term at
                    Fidelity Investments Canada, I was also fortunate enough to experience a variety of the
                    different roles involved in a development team. I was not only involved in web application
                    development, but also experienced work in log analysis and QA testing. For the majority of
                    my four months at Fidelity,I worked on continuing a proof of concept project and producing
                    a minimum viable product of a Log Analysis tool, using MongoBD, Express, Angular and NodeJs
                    to do so.

                    interest in web development and mobile development. I am extremely passionate about learning
                    and working with new technologies that I strive to work on projects that improve my skills or
                    allow me to learn new things frequently. Due to my internship as a QA, I have experience working
                    in an agile environment, a solid high-level knowledge of the app development process. Furthermore,
                    I have skills in Java, C, Vanilla JavaScript, Nodejs, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, EJS, and deploying
                    Nodejs apps using Heroku CLI. During my time at Clearbridge Mobile, I was involved in automating
                    UI testing using Appium, Java and API testing using Postman. I am excited for this project because
                    I have an opportunity to work with a solid team and create a product that has a positive impact on
                    many people.
