                            Sotos Dorito is a 58 year-old male owner of a local greek restaurant that serves the finest authentic greek food in Scarborough. Unfortunately, Sotos is not so in-tune with modern day technology as he is with his restaurant’s food. Sotos is a simple user of the internet, he owns no smart-phones and browses the web through his 7-year-old laptop that he was given as a birthday gift. Sotos does not own a website for his restaurant and hopes that he gains popularity directly through the taste of this food. Due to the recent pandemic, sales for his restaurant have gone down significantly. He is losing the customers he previously had. As it stands, Sotos Dorito doesn’t have any way to pick up the losses he has incurred, and is looking for solutions to help him get out of this rut.

Every day, people always say the food is excellent, but no one bothers to ask who it is cooked by or appreciate his culinary skills personally. He can only reach so many customers through direct communication. He wants for everyone to hear why he became a chef and how he became such a good chef. He loves cooking so much so that he has a youtube channel where he teaches others how to cook as well as photos of some of the things he makes at home. He just wants to share his story.                        </p>

                            Selena is a 30 year old woman in Scarborough who doesn’t eat out a lot. When she does have to order out, she often struggles with choosing a place to eat. She would have to spend hours and hours looking for the perfect place to eat. Since she is fairly new to Scarborough, she doesn’t know a lot about the cuisine available. She enjoys certain types of food, but she doesn’t know where to find them. She doesn’t have many friends in Scarborough to suggest foods/restaurants she may like. She doesn’t want to spend a lot of time when ordering, as she has a very busy schedule, so the quicker the process the better.
